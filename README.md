# Drone Competation

## A Math Problem

This is a C++ implement of the math problem: 'drone competation', which is one of the topics of mathematical modeling.

The project haven't been compiled yet, because I haven't finished writing the main code, so I don't know is there any logical bug. I'm trying my best to avoid those matters, but some small mistakes may be ignored. It will be compiled and debugged as soon as possible, maybe tomorrow (08/16/2021).

- [ ] Finish main functions.
- [ ] Compile once.
